The San Francisco civil society group, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), welcomed the decision of Tesla Motors to adopt an open source philosophy in respect of intellectual property. Adi Kamdar of the EFF commented: ‘Patent trolls run rampage while some big 48 Ibid. 49 Ibid. 50 Ibid. 51 Matthew Rimmer, *Intellectual Property and Climate Change: Inventing Clean Technologies*, Cheltenham (UK) and Northampton (Mass.): Edward Elgar, September 2011. 16 ----- ## companies spend more money on patent wars than research and development.’ [52] He observed: ‘This is why it is so encouraging when companies commit to openness, ensuring their patents do not obstruct future innovation.’ [53] Adi Kamdar observed that the EFF had a published a guide to alternative patent licensing. [54] He implored: ‘We would love to see Tesla commit their patents explicitly under an agreement like the Defensive Patent License, which sets a clear standard that patents are to be both shared and used for good.’ [55] Kamdar observed that Musk’s stance on patent law was supported by a recent study by MIT’s Catherine Tucker on ‘The Effect of\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_7]"}, "final_answer": null, "tags": ["sandbox"], "success": true, "metadata": {}}]}
